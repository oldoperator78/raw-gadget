Raw Gadget Examples
===================

This directory contains two examples of using Raw Gadget:

- `keyboard.c` emulates a USB keyboard that keeps sending keypresses of the letter `X`.
This example also handles the USB device being reset by the host;

- `printer.c` emulates the enumeration stage of a USB printer.

When run without arguments, the examples rely on the [Dummy HCD/UDC](/dummy_hcd) module to emulate virtual devices that connect to the kernel they are running on.
If you want to use them with a physical host instead, you need to provide the [UDC device and driver names](/README.md#usb-device-controllers) as arguments (e.g. both are `20980000.usb` for Raspberry Pi Zero).

Also see [tests/gadget.c](/tests/gadget.c) for an example of a device that is used with the Raw Gadget testing suite.
