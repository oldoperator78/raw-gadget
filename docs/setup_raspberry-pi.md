Raw Gadget on Raspberry Pi
==========================

This document contains the end-to-end instructions on how to set up Raw Gadget on a Raspberri Pi board.
The instructions were tested on Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero W, Raspberry Pi 4 B, and Raspberry Pi 5, but they should be easily adaptable to other boards.


## Required hardware

- Raspberry Pi board;
- SD card and SD card reader;
- USB UART adapter with jumper cables (or a [Pi-specific adapter](https://8086.net/products#80860010));
- USB Ethernet adapter (or Wi-Fi support on the board);
- USB cables.


## Instructions

1. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) the latest `Raspberry Pi OS with desktop` image.

    The `Lite` version will likely work as well;

2. Extract the downloaded image and flash it into an SD card:

    ``` bash
    unxz 2025-05-13-raspios-bookworm-arm64.img.xz
    sudo dd if=2025-05-13-raspios-bookworm-arm64.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M conv=fsync
    ```

3. [Create](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=333248&p=1994926#p1994926) a user `pi` with the password `raspberry` by creating a `bootfs/userconf.txt` file with the following contents:

   ```
   pi:$6$c70VpvPsVNCG0YR5$l5vWWLsLko9Kj65gcQ8qvMkuOoRkEagI90qi3F/Y7rm8eNYZHW8CY6BOIKwMH7a3YYzZYL90zf304cAHLFaZE0
   ```

4. [Enable UART](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html#enable_uart) by appending `enable_uart=1` to the end of the `bootfs/config.txt` file;

5. Boot the board and get a shell over UART.

    For this step, you will need a USB UART adapter with jumper cables.

    [Here](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-creation/give-it-life) are the instructions for Raspberry Pi Zero.

    Note that getting the login prompt over UART takes a few minutes when you boot the board for the first time.

    Getting a shell over SSH is also fine as long as the USB OTG port on the board remains available.
    Thus, on Raspberry Pi Zero (without Wi-Fi) you must get a shell over UART, as the USB Ethernet cable would take up the USB OTG port;

6. Get the board connected to the Internet by plugging in a USB Ethernet adapter or [use Wi-Fi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#connect-to-a-wireless-network-2) on a Wi-Fiâ€“enabled board;

7. Update the packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo reboot`;

8. Install useful packages: `sudo apt install vim git`;

9. Install the Linux kernel headers by following [these instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#kernel-headers);

10. Setup the dwc2 UDC driver:

    ``` bash
    echo "dtoverlay=dwc2" | sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt
    echo "dwc2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
    sudo reboot
    ```

11. Clone the Raw Gadget [repository](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget);

12. Build and load the USB Raw Gadget module following [these instructions](/raw_gadget);

13. Connect the Raspberry Pi USB OTG port to a USB host.

    On Raspberry Pi Zero, this port is titled `USB` on the board.
    You will need to unplug the USB Ethernet adapter for this step if you have it plugged in.

    On Raspberry Pi 4 B, the OTG port is the Type-C one titled `POWER IN`.
    It can be used for both powering the board and emulating USB devices at the same time.
    You might need to power off the board to reconnect it to the USB host;

14. Build and run the Raw Gadget [keyboard emulator program](/examples):

    ``` bash
    cd raw-gadget/examples
    make
    sudo ./keyboard 1000480000.usb 1000480000.usb
    ```

    You might need to change the [UDC device and driver names](/README.md#usb-device-controllers);

15. Make sure that you see the letter `X` being entered on the host.

    With this step, you confirmed that Raw Gadget is working properly.


## Additional instructions

To turn Raspberry Pi Zero W into a drive-by USB attack tool:

1. Set up a Wi-Fi hotspot;

2. Enable SSH server;

3. Solder [Zero Stem](https://zerostem.io/) onto the board.

You can now connect the board to any USB port, wait for it to boot, join its Wi-Fi network, `ssh` onto it, and emulate arbitrary USB devices via Raw Gadget or other Linux USB Gadget interfaces.
